#1. Create a hash called `perfect_10_recipe` that has the following data:

perfect_10_recipe = {
  :almond_flour => "2 cups",
  :gluten_free_whole_oats => "1 cup",
  :kosher_salt => "1/2 tea spoon",
  :baking_powder => "1/2 tea spoon",
  :baking_soda => "1/4 tea spoon",
  :xanthan_gum => "1/2 tea spoon",
  :slivered_almonds => "1/4 cup",
  :mini_dark_chocolate_chips => "3/4 cup",
  :olive_oil => "1/2 cup",
  :agave => "1/4 cup"
}

def recipe_ingredients(perfect_10_recipe)
  return perfect_10_recipe
end

def amount_of_chocolate_chips(perfect_10_recipe)
  return perfect_10_recipe[:mini_dark_chocolate_chips]
end

#3: Use `puts` to print out every ingredient and amount in the hash by iterating through the collection. You'll want to use the `each` method.
def ingredients_and_amounts(perfect_10_recipe)
  perfect_10_recipe.each do |ingredient, amount|
    puts "#{ingredient} #{amount}"
end

#4: Now use `puts` to print out just the ingredients without the amounts. You'll want to use the `each_key` method.
def ingredients(perfect_10_recipe)
  perfect_10_recipe.each_key do |ingredient|
  puts "#{ingredient}"
end

#5: Now use `puts` to print out just the amounts without the ingredients. You'll want to use the `each_value` method.
def amounts(perfect_10_recipe)
  perfect_10_recipe.each_value do |amount|
    puts "#{amount}"
end

#6: Return the number of ingredients in the `perfect_10_recipe` hash.
def number_ingredients(perfect_10_recipe)
  perfect_10_recipe.length
end
end
end
end
